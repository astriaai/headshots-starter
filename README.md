## Incoming changes

Incoming [PR]((https://github.com/astriaai/headshots-starter/pull/121)) has been merged to allow usage of  Astria's packs API which helps you avoid hardcoding prompts in your code as well as offering different packs of prompts, and switching to the new Flux model fine-tuning easily.
Read more on advantage of using packs [Astria's documentation](https://docs.astria.ai/docs/api/pack/pack/).

When migrating to the new packs api, add to your vercel environment:
```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_TUNE_TYPE=packs
PACK_QUERY_TYPE=both
```

## Running Locally

To create your own Headshot AI app, follow these steps:

**Note**
Training models is only available on paid plans. You'll need an active [Astria API Key](<[url](https://www.astria.ai/pricing)>) to train models.

### 1. Vercel template

To setup Supabase/Vercel and your github repo, click on the Vercel Deploy Button and follow the steps.

IMPORTANT: In the Supabase integration step: Make sure you leave the Create sample tables option checked. This might take a few minutes to complete.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fleap-ai%2Fheadshots-starter%2Ftree%2Fmain&env=ASTRIA_API_KEY,APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET&envDescription=Set%20up%20environment%20variables%20for%20Leap%20AI%20and%20redirect%20URL%20in%20Supabase%20Auth%20dashboard.%20See%20.env.local.example%20for%20full%20config%20with%20Resend%20and%20Stripe.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fleap-ai%2Fheadshots-starter%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.local.example&project-name=headshots-starter-clone&repository-name=headshots-starter-clone&demo-title=AI%20Headshot%20Generator&demo-description=A%20Professional%20AI%20headshot%20generator%20starter%20kit%20powered%20by%20Next.js%2C%20Leap%20AI%2C%20and%20Vercel&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getheadshots.ai%2F&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F1CEDfTwO5vPEiNMgN2Y1t6%2F245d1e0c11c4d8e734fbe345b9ecdc7c%2Fdemo.png&integration-ids=oac_VqOgBHqhEoFTPzGkPd7L0iH6&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fleap-ai%2Fheadshots-starter%2Ftree%2Fmain)

The Vercel Deployment will create a new repository with this template on your GitHub account and guide you through a new Supabase project creation. The Supabase Vercel Deploy Integration will set up the necessary Supabase environment variables and run the SQL migrations to set up the Database schema on your account. You can inspect the created tables in your project's Table editor.

This will create the tables with their respective columns and RLS policies:

- credits
- images
- models
- samples

### 2. Clone your newly created repo:

```
git clone {{your-repo-name}}
```

### 3. Enter your newly created repo's directory:

```
cd {{your-repo-name}}
```

### 4. Install dependencies:

For npm:

```bash
npm install
```

For yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### 5. Magic Link Auth (Supabase)

In your supabase [dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/), select newly created project, go to Authentication -> Email Templates -> Magic Link and paste the following template:

```
<h2>Magic Link</h2>
<p>Follow this link to login:</p>
<p><a href="{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email">Log In</a></p>
```

Then, make sure to setup your site URL and redirect urls in the supabase dashboard under Authentication -> URL Configuration.

For example:

Site URL: https://headshots-starter.vercel.app

Redirect URL: https://headshots-starter.vercel.app/**

### 6. Create a [Astria](https://www.astria.ai/) account

In your `.env.local` file:

- Fill in `your_api_key` with your [Astria API key](https://www.astria.ai/users/edit#api)
- Fill in `your-webhook-secret` with any arbitrary URL friendly string eg.`shadf892yr398hq23h`
- Fill in `your-vercel-url` with a url to catch webhooks from Astria. This will be your vercel deployment url or Ngrok tunnel locally (eg. https://{your-hosted-url}/astria/train-webhook)
- Fill in `your-blob-read-write-token` with your Vercel Blob token (steps below)

If your production webhook callbacks do not seem to be working, make sure the callback URL is not of a Vercel dedicated branch deployment which requires authentication, in which case you will not see the callback in the logs.
### 7. Configure the Announcement Bar (Optional)

To enable and customize the announcement bar at the top of your site, configure these environment variables in your `.env.local`:

```text
# Announcement Bar Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANNOUNCEMENT_ENABLED=true # set to false to disable the announcement bar
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANNOUNCEMENT_MESSAGE="Your announcement message here" # the message to display
```


### 8. Configure [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/quickstart#client-uploads) for image uploads

In your Vercel project, create a [Blob store](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/quickstart#create-a-blob-store)

- In your Vercel dashboard, select the Storage tab, then select the Connect Database button.
- Under the Create New tab, select Blob and then the Continue button.

Then to configure in your .env:

- In your Vercel dashboard, select the Settings tab, then select the Environment Variables tab.
- Copy your `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to your .env

### 9. Create a [Resend](https://resend.com/) account (Optional)

- Fill in `your-resend-api-key` with your Resend API Key if you wish to use Resend to email users when their model has finished training.

### 10. Configure [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to bill users on a credit basis. (Optional)

The current setup is for a credit based system. 1 credit = 1 model train.

To enable Stripe billing, you will need to fill out the following fields in your `.env.local` file:

- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-stripe-webhook-secret
- STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ONE_CREDIT=your-stripe-price-id-one-credit
- STRIPE_PRICE_ID_THREE_CREDITS=your-stripe-price-id-three-credit
- STRIPE_PRICE_ID_FIVE_CREDITS=your-stripe-price-id-five-credit
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_IS_ENABLED=false # set to true to enable Stripe payments

You need to do multiple things to get Stripe working:

- Get your Stripe API secret key from the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
- Create a [Stripe Webhook](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) that will point to your hosted URL. The webhook should be listening for the `checkout.session.completed` event. The webhook should point to `your-hosted-url/stripe/subscription-webhook`.
- Create a [Stripe Price](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products) for each credit package you want to offer.
- Create a [Stripe Pricing Table](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/pricing-tables) and replace the script @/components/stripe/StripeTable.tsx with your own values. It should look like this:

```js
<stripe-pricing-table
  pricing-table-id="your-stripe-pricing-table-id"
  publishable-key="your-stripe-publishable-key"
  client-reference-id={user.id}
  customer-email={user.email}
></stripe-pricing-table>
```

Here are the products you need to create to get Stripe working with our example, checkout the images [Here](/public/Stripe/)

To create them go on the Stripe dashboard, search for Product Catalog and then click on the add product button on the top right of the screen. You will need to create 3 products, one for each credit package as shown in the images before. We set them to One time payments, but you can change that if you want to and you can set the price too. After creating the products make sure to update the variables in the .env.local [your-stripe-price-id-one-credit, your-stripe-price-id-three-credit, your-stripe-price-id-five-credit] with their respective price ids, each price id is found in the product page at the bottom.

### 11. Start the development server:

For npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### 12. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the running app.

## How To Get Good Results

[![Good results Demo](/public/good_results.png)](https://blog.tryleap.ai/create-an-ai-headshot-generator-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-with-leap-api/#step-1-gather-your-image-samples-%F0%9F%93%B8)

The image samples used to teach the model what your face looks like are critical. Garbage in = garbage out.

- Enforce close-ups of faces and consider cropping so that the face is centered.
- Enforce images with only one person in the frame.
- Avoid accessories in samples like sunglasses and hats.
- Ensure the face is clearly visible. (For face detection, consider using tools like [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/face_detection_based_transformations?ref=blog.tryleap.ai)).

[![Avoid multiple faces](/public/multiple_faces.png)](https://blog.tryleap.ai/create-an-ai-headshot-generator-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-with-leap-api/#how-to-avoid-multiple-faces-in-results-%E2%9D%8C)

If you get distorted results with multiple faces, repeated subjects, multiple limbs, etc, make sure to follow these steps and minimize the chance of this happening:

- Make sure any samples uploaded are the same 1:1 height / width aspect ratio, for example 512x512, 1024x1024, etc.
- Avoid multiple people in the samples uploaded.
- Add "double torso, totem pole" to the negative prompt when generating.
- Make sure your dimensions when generating are also 1:1 with the same height / width ratios of the samples.
